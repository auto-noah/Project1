# Ray Tracing Renderer

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a ray tracing renderer designed as an extension to an existing interactive OpenGL renderer. It simulates realistic light interactions with materials and surfaces to create ray traced images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (Recommended version: 17.6.5)
- C++17 compatible compiler

### Installation

Clone the repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/auto-noah/Project1.git
cd Project1
```

Then open **Project.sln** within Visual Studio, change your configuration from running in x64 to x86, and compile.

There is a **Render** menu option located at the top of the window. When selecting the drop down option **Ray Trace**, you change from viewing an OpenGL rendering to our custom raytracing render.
